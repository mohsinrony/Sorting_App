# Sorting_App created using ReactJS
Bubble sort / Selection sort are simplest sorting algorithms.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort

It is short and simple, e.g. a textbox where user inputs array and sorting is done according to these items. You can also select sorting algorithm from a dropdown menu to select the algorithm method. Here, I have kept three methods, which are Bubble sort, Selection sort and Quick sort.
